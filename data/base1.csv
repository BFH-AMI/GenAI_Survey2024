Just as it is no longer necessary for small children to learn how to use a pen and to write beautiful text as they did many years ago, I think that it will be increasing less that we spend time when we are children, learning facts and figures, because those facts and figures will be instantly at our disposal whenever we need them. So I think this will have a revolution on the topics that we teach to children probably it‚Äôs a good thing, because we will be able to spend more time focusing on social skills and just learning stupid things such as the year and what your person was born or what day of the week a world war started on"
